Title: Headless, boneless, skinless, & lifeless UI (5 minute read)
Description: There are four categories of UI abstractions: Headless UI, Boneless UI, Skinless UI, and Lifeless UI. "Headless UI" is a common term where the abstractions often have underlying functionality and structure. "Boneless" refers to UI libraries that provide composable styles but no markup, while "skinless" provides functioning markup with no styling. "Lifeless" UI abstractions, like TanStack, offer typesafe hooks and logic without rendering actual UI elements, leaving the developer responsible for applying those functions to elements and styles.

Title: Headless, boneless, skinless, & lifeless UI (5 minute read)
Description: There are four categories of UI abstractions: Headless UI, Boneless UI, Skinless UI, and Lifeless UI. "Headless UI" is a common term where the abstractions often have underlying functionality and structure. "Boneless" refers to UI libraries that provide composable styles but no markup, while "skinless" provides functioning markup with no styling. "Lifeless" UI abstractions, like TanStack, offer typesafe hooks and logic without rendering actual UI elements, leaving the developer responsible for applying those functions to elements and styles.

Title: React Folder Structure in 5 Steps [2024] (22 minute read)
Description: When organizing React folder structure, devs should separate components, features, and technical concerns into dedicated folders and files for better organization and maintainability. A "barrel file" approach should be used for public APIs, but this is becoming less popular in JavaScript due to its impact on tree shaking.

Title: Headless, boneless, skinless, & lifeless UI (5 minute read)
Description: There are four categories of UI abstractions: Headless UI, Boneless UI, Skinless UI, and Lifeless UI. "Headless UI" is a common term where the abstractions often have underlying functionality and structure. "Boneless" refers to UI libraries that provide composable styles but no markup, while "skinless" provides functioning markup with no styling. "Lifeless" UI abstractions, like TanStack, offer typesafe hooks and logic without rendering actual UI elements, leaving the developer responsible for applying those functions to elements and styles.

Title: Headless, boneless, skinless, & lifeless UI (5 minute read)
Description: There are four categories of UI abstractions: Headless UI, Boneless UI, Skinless UI, and Lifeless UI. "Headless UI" is a common term where the abstractions often have underlying functionality and structure. "Boneless" refers to UI libraries that provide composable styles but no markup, while "skinless" provides functioning markup with no styling. "Lifeless" UI abstractions, like TanStack, offer typesafe hooks and logic without rendering actual UI elements, leaving the developer responsible for applying those functions to elements and styles.

Title: React Folder Structure in 5 Steps [2024] (22 minute read)
Description: When organizing React folder structure, devs should separate components, features, and technical concerns into dedicated folders and files for better organization and maintainability. A "barrel file" approach should be used for public APIs, but this is becoming less popular in JavaScript due to its impact on tree shaking.

Title: Headless, boneless, skinless, & lifeless UI (5 minute read)
Description: There are four categories of UI abstractions: Headless UI, Boneless UI, Skinless UI, and Lifeless UI. "Headless UI" is a common term where the abstractions often have underlying functionality and structure. "Boneless" refers to UI libraries that provide composable styles but no markup, while "skinless" provides functioning markup with no styling. "Lifeless" UI abstractions, like TanStack, offer typesafe hooks and logic without rendering actual UI elements, leaving the developer responsible for applying those functions to elements and styles.

Title: Headless, boneless, skinless, & lifeless UI (5 minute read)
Description: There are four categories of UI abstractions: Headless UI, Boneless UI, Skinless UI, and Lifeless UI. "Headless UI" is a common term where the abstractions often have underlying functionality and structure. "Boneless" refers to UI libraries that provide composable styles but no markup, while "skinless" provides functioning markup with no styling. "Lifeless" UI abstractions, like TanStack, offer typesafe hooks and logic without rendering actual UI elements, leaving the developer responsible for applying those functions to elements and styles.

Description: There are four categories of UI abstractions: Headless UI, Boneless UI, Skinless UI, and Lifeless UI. "Headless UI" is a common term where the abstractions often have underlying functionality and structure. "Boneless" refers to UI libraries that provide composable styles but no markup, while "skinless" provides functioning markup with no styling. "Lifeless" UI abstractions, like TanStack, offer typesafe hooks and logic without rendering actual UI elements, leaving the developer responsible for applying those functions to elements and styles.

Title: Headless, boneless, skinless, & lifeless UI (5 minute read)
Description: There are four categories of UI abstractions: Headless UI, Boneless UI, Skinless UI, and Lifeless UI. "Headless UI" is a common term where the abstractions often have underlying functionality and structure. "Boneless" refers to UI libraries that provide composable styles but no markup, while "skinless" provides functioning markup with no styling. "Lifeless" UI abstractions, like TanStack, offer typesafe hooks and logic without rendering actual UI elements, leaving the developer responsible for applying those functions to elements and styles.

Title: Headless, boneless, skinless, & lifeless UI (5 minute read)
Description: There are four categories of UI abstractions: Headless UI, Boneless UI, Skinless UI, and Lifeless UI. "Headless UI" is a common term where the abstractions often have underlying functionality and structure. "Boneless" refers to UI libraries that provide composable styles but no markup, while "skinless" provides functioning markup with no styling. "Lifeless" UI abstractions, like TanStack, offer typesafe hooks and logic without rendering actual UI elements, leaving the developer responsible for applying those functions to elements and styles.

Title: Headless, boneless, skinless, & lifeless UI (5 minute read)
Description: There are four categories of UI abstractions: Headless UI, Boneless UI, Skinless UI, and Lifeless UI. "Headless UI" is a common term where the abstractions often have underlying functionality and structure. "Boneless" refers to UI libraries that provide composable styles but no markup, while "skinless" provides functioning markup with no styling. "Lifeless" UI abstractions, like TanStack, offer typesafe hooks and logic without rendering actual UI elements, leaving the developer responsible for applying those functions to elements and styles.

Title: Headless, boneless, skinless, & lifeless UI (5 minute read)
Description: There are four categories of UI abstractions: Headless UI, Boneless UI, Skinless UI, and Lifeless UI. "Headless UI" is a common term where the abstractions often have underlying functionality and structure. "Boneless" refers to UI libraries that provide composable styles but no markup, while "skinless" provides functioning markup with no styling. "Lifeless" UI abstractions, like TanStack, offer typesafe hooks and logic without rendering actual UI elements, leaving the developer responsible for applying those functions to elements and styles.

Title: How I failed to make a game (7 minute read)
Description: This developer attempted to create a raycasting engine for the GameBoy Advance. The project was initially successful, with a focus on technical development, but ultimately failed due to the developer's lack of interest in creating content. The process of building assets, designing controls, and addressing the limitations of the GBA screen was too tedious and frustrating.

Title: Liskov's Gun: The Parallel Evolution of React and Web Components (57 minute read)
Description: Web components, though technically useful, have been hampered by over-aggressive promotion and a lack of early support from major browser vendors. Meanwhile, React gained popularity by promising a magical solution to UI development and by inadvertently commodifying developers. This situation has led to a schism within the web development community, with three factions: standards-oriented developers, web component framework implementers, and other reactive framework developers.

Title: React Folder Structure in 5 Steps [2024] (22 minute read)
Description: When organizing React folder structure, devs should separate components, features, and technical concerns into dedicated folders and files for better organization and maintainability. A "barrel file" approach should be used for public APIs, but this is becoming less popular in JavaScript due to its impact on tree shaking.

Title: Headless, boneless, skinless, & lifeless UI (5 minute read)
Description: There are four categories of UI abstractions: Headless UI, Boneless UI, Skinless UI, and Lifeless UI. "Headless UI" is a common term where the abstractions often have underlying functionality and structure. "Boneless" refers to UI libraries that provide composable styles but no markup, while "skinless" provides functioning markup with no styling. "Lifeless" UI abstractions, like TanStack, offer typesafe hooks and logic without rendering actual UI elements, leaving the developer responsible for applying those functions to elements and styles.

Title: React Folder Structure in 5 Steps [2024] (22 minute read)
Description: When organizing React folder structure, devs should separate components, features, and technical concerns into dedicated folders and files for better organization and maintainability. A "barrel file" approach should be used for public APIs, but this is becoming less popular in JavaScript due to its impact on tree shaking.

Title: How We Generated Millions of Content Annotations (6 minute read)
Description: Spotify has built a platform to manage and scale its content annotation processes. It focuses on three key areas: scaling human expertise, developing flexible annotation tools, and establishing a robust infrastructure for integration. The platform allows Spotify to generate millions of high-quality annotations efficiently, letting it develop and iterate on ML models faster.

Title: Headless, boneless, skinless, & lifeless UI (5 minute read)
Description: There are four categories of UI abstractions: Headless UI, Boneless UI, Skinless UI, and Lifeless UI. "Headless UI" is a common term where the abstractions often have underlying functionality and structure. "Boneless" refers to UI libraries that provide composable styles but no markup, while "skinless" provides functioning markup with no styling. "Lifeless" UI abstractions, like TanStack, offer typesafe hooks and logic without rendering actual UI elements, leaving the developer responsible for applying those functions to elements and styles.

Title: Headless, boneless, skinless, & lifeless UI (5 minute read)
Description: There are four categories of UI abstractions: Headless UI, Boneless UI, Skinless UI, and Lifeless UI. "Headless UI" is a common term where the abstractions often have underlying functionality and structure. "Boneless" refers to UI libraries that provide composable styles but no markup, while "skinless" provides functioning markup with no styling. "Lifeless" UI abstractions, like TanStack, offer typesafe hooks and logic without rendering actual UI elements, leaving the developer responsible for applying those functions to elements and styles.

Title: Liskov's Gun: The Parallel Evolution of React and Web Components (57 minute read)
Description: Web components, though technically useful, have been hampered by over-aggressive promotion and a lack of early support from major browser vendors. Meanwhile, React gained popularity by promising a magical solution to UI development and by inadvertently commodifying developers. This situation has led to a schism within the web development community, with three factions: standards-oriented developers, web component framework implementers, and other reactive framework developers.

Title: Headless, boneless, skinless, & lifeless UI (5 minute read)
Description: There are four categories of UI abstractions: Headless UI, Boneless UI, Skinless UI, and Lifeless UI. "Headless UI" is a common term where the abstractions often have underlying functionality and structure. "Boneless" refers to UI libraries that provide composable styles but no markup, while "skinless" provides functioning markup with no styling. "Lifeless" UI abstractions, like TanStack, offer typesafe hooks and logic without rendering actual UI elements, leaving the developer responsible for applying those functions to elements and styles.

Title: Liskov's Gun: The Parallel Evolution of React and Web Components (57 minute read)
Description: Web components, though technically useful, have been hampered by over-aggressive promotion and a lack of early support from major browser vendors. Meanwhile, React gained popularity by promising a magical solution to UI development and by inadvertently commodifying developers. This situation has led to a schism within the web development community, with three factions: standards-oriented developers, web component framework implementers, and other reactive framework developers.

Title: Headless, boneless, skinless, & lifeless UI (5 minute read)
Description: There are four categories of UI abstractions: Headless UI, Boneless UI, Skinless UI, and Lifeless UI. "Headless UI" is a common term where the abstractions often have underlying functionality and structure. "Boneless" refers to UI libraries that provide composable styles but no markup, while "skinless" provides functioning markup with no styling. "Lifeless" UI abstractions, like TanStack, offer typesafe hooks and logic without rendering actual UI elements, leaving the developer responsible for applying those functions to elements and styles.

Title: Headless, boneless, skinless, & lifeless UI (5 minute read)
Description: There are four categories of UI abstractions: Headless UI, Boneless UI, Skinless UI, and Lifeless UI. "Headless UI" is a common term where the abstractions often have underlying functionality and structure. "Boneless" refers to UI libraries that provide composable styles but no markup, while "skinless" provides functioning markup with no styling. "Lifeless" UI abstractions, like TanStack, offer typesafe hooks and logic without rendering actual UI elements, leaving the developer responsible for applying those functions to elements and styles.

Title: Headless, boneless, skinless, & lifeless UI (5 minute read)
Description: There are four categories of UI abstractions: Headless UI, Boneless UI, Skinless UI, and Lifeless UI. "Headless UI" is a common term where the abstractions often have underlying functionality and structure. "Boneless" refers to UI libraries that provide composable styles but no markup, while "skinless" provides functioning markup with no styling. "Lifeless" UI abstractions, like TanStack, offer typesafe hooks and logic without rendering actual UI elements, leaving the developer responsible for applying those functions to elements and styles.

Title: React Folder Structure in 5 Steps [2024] (22 minute read)
Description: When organizing React folder structure, devs should separate components, features, and technical concerns into dedicated folders and files for better organization and maintainability. A "barrel file" approach should be used for public APIs, but this is becoming less popular in JavaScript due to its impact on tree shaking.

Title: Headless, boneless, skinless, & lifeless UI (5 minute read)
Description: There are four categories of UI abstractions: Headless UI, Boneless UI, Skinless UI, and Lifeless UI. "Headless UI" is a common term where the abstractions often have underlying functionality and structure. "Boneless" refers to UI libraries that provide composable styles but no markup, while "skinless" provides functioning markup with no styling. "Lifeless" UI abstractions, like TanStack, offer typesafe hooks and logic without rendering actual UI elements, leaving the developer responsible for applying those functions to elements and styles.

Title: Liskov's Gun: The Parallel Evolution of React and Web Components (57 minute read)
Description: Web components, though technically useful, have been hampered by over-aggressive promotion and a lack of early support from major browser vendors. Meanwhile, React gained popularity by promising a magical solution to UI development and by inadvertently commodifying developers. This situation has led to a schism within the web development community, with three factions: standards-oriented developers, web component framework implementers, and other reactive framework developers.

Title: React Folder Structure in 5 Steps [2024] (22 minute read)
Description: When organizing React folder structure, devs should separate components, features, and technical concerns into dedicated folders and files for better organization and maintainability. A "barrel file" approach should be used for public APIs, but this is becoming less popular in JavaScript due to its impact on tree shaking.

Title: Headless, boneless, skinless, & lifeless UI (5 minute read)
Description: There are four categories of UI abstractions: Headless UI, Boneless UI, Skinless UI, and Lifeless UI. "Headless UI" is a common term where the abstractions often have underlying functionality and structure. "Boneless" refers to UI libraries that provide composable styles but no markup, while "skinless" provides functioning markup with no styling. "Lifeless" UI abstractions, like TanStack, offer typesafe hooks and logic without rendering actual UI elements, leaving the developer responsible for applying those functions to elements and styles.

Title: Headless, boneless, skinless, & lifeless UI (5 minute read)
Description: There are four categories of UI abstractions: Headless UI, Boneless UI, Skinless UI, and Lifeless UI. "Headless UI" is a common term where the abstractions often have underlying functionality and structure. "Boneless" refers to UI libraries that provide composable styles but no markup, while "skinless" provides functioning markup with no styling. "Lifeless" UI abstractions, like TanStack, offer typesafe hooks and logic without rendering actual UI elements, leaving the developer responsible for applying those functions to elements and styles.

Title: How I failed to make a game (7 minute read)
Description: This developer attempted to create a raycasting engine for the GameBoy Advance. The project was initially successful, with a focus on technical development, but ultimately failed due to the developer's lack of interest in creating content. The process of building assets, designing controls, and addressing the limitations of the GBA screen was too tedious and frustrating.

Title: Liskov's Gun: The Parallel Evolution of React and Web Components (57 minute read)
Description: Web components, though technically useful, have been hampered by over-aggressive promotion and a lack of early support from major browser vendors. Meanwhile, React gained popularity by promising a magical solution to UI development and by inadvertently commodifying developers. This situation has led to a schism within the web development community, with three factions: standards-oriented developers, web component framework implementers, and other reactive framework developers.

Description: There are four categories of UI abstractions: Headless UI, Boneless UI, Skinless UI, and Lifeless UI. "Headless UI" is a common term where the abstractions often have underlying functionality and structure. "Boneless" refers to UI libraries that provide composable styles but no markup, while "skinless" provides functioning markup with no styling. "Lifeless" UI abstractions, like TanStack, offer typesafe hooks and logic without rendering actual UI elements, leaving the developer responsible for applying those functions to elements and styles.

Title: Headless, boneless, skinless, & lifeless UI (5 minute read)
Description: There are four categories of UI abstractions: Headless UI, Boneless UI, Skinless UI, and Lifeless UI. "Headless UI" is a common term where the abstractions often have underlying functionality and structure. "Boneless" refers to UI libraries that provide composable styles but no markup, while "skinless" provides functioning markup with no styling. "Lifeless" UI abstractions, like TanStack, offer typesafe hooks and logic without rendering actual UI elements, leaving the developer responsible for applying those functions to elements and styles.

Title: React Folder Structure in 5 Steps [2024] (22 minute read)
Description: When organizing React folder structure, devs should separate components, features, and technical concerns into dedicated folders and files for better organization and maintainability. A "barrel file" approach should be used for public APIs, but this is becoming less popular in JavaScript due to its impact on tree shaking.

Title: Headless, boneless, skinless, & lifeless UI (5 minute read)
Description: There are four categories of UI abstractions: Headless UI, Boneless UI, Skinless UI, and Lifeless UI. "Headless UI" is a common term where the abstractions often have underlying functionality and structure. "Boneless" refers to UI libraries that provide composable styles but no markup, while "skinless" provides functioning markup with no styling. "Lifeless" UI abstractions, like TanStack, offer typesafe hooks and logic without rendering actual UI elements, leaving the developer responsible for applying those functions to elements and styles.

"Lifeless" UI abstractions, like TanStack, offer typesafe hooks and logic without rendering actual UI elements, leaving the developer responsible for applying those functions to elements and styles.
